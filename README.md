PulseBoard is a real-time GitHub insights dashboard that turns raw repository events into an at-a-glance leaderboard and deep contributor analytics. The application is under refactoring and development for release soon. It marries the precision of GitHubâ€™s GraphQL API with sub-second web-socket updates and a sleek React + Next.js UI, giving engineering leads instant feedback on workflow health, code velocity and team engagement.
